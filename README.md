personal page using nodeJS with Express framework as web server and html/css/js on front end. 
This is my first ever personal website and my first time creating a web app using pure JS. I am trying to embrace the new 
principles of ES6. In my professional life I have most of my experience developing/designing Java EE web apps, and web services.
I also have experience with python and ASP.NET MVC, but I am trying to become more well rounded with front end technologies.
That was the movivating factor for this page.
